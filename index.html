        <h2 class="about-position"> Climbing coach</h2>
        <h1 class="about-name"> Mavrodi Sofia</h1>
       <p class="about-description"> As a climbing coach, specialize in group and individual training for adults and children of all ages. I have been coach more than 6 years. I regularly worked with people in groups (small: 5-10 and large: more then 15 people) and led personal training. I was preparing athletes for competitions, created special programs for them and for sportsman with injuries. My previous work experience gave me the opportunity to improve my knowledge and skills in children psychology and finding an individual approach to each person of big group. In addition, I coached children with special needs (autistic, for example) as part of their rehabilitation program. 
        Systematically I organized outdoor rock-climbing  trips in different countries and arranged camps and training there. Also I organized and led children's parties and special events, monitoring compliance  with safety regulations  and others.
        Another important part of my work was route-setting of regular routes for the gym and routes for competitions in different gyms in Ukraine, Germany and Malta. 
        I have been rock climbing for about 10 years and have category of candidate master of sports. Maximum category on rocks 8a, onsite 7b+. 
        I'm good at following instructions, at the same time I show initiative where necessary. I operate well in a team. 
        Finally, I am passionate about working with people, especially with children and glad to improve my skills and knowledge.   </p>
